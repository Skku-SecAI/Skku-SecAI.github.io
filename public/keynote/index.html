                                    <strong>Abstract</strong>: Recent threats on computer memory increase the need for
                                    memory protection against eavesdropping or tampering, requiring the use of
                                    symmetric-key cryptography community for low-latency encryption. This talk discusses
                                    research directions and technological advancements of low-latency encryption and its
                                    application to memory encryption.

                                    <strong>Abstract</strong>: Hardware trojans (HTs) represent one of the most
                                    challenging threat models in computer security. Due to the complexity and
                                    distributed nature of todayâ€™s electronics supply chains, there has been significant
                                    interest in developing scalable and accurate techniques for identifying such
                                    embedded malicious logic, at least in critical systems. However, much of the
                                    research in such techniques focuses on small target circuits with impractical HT
                                    usage (i.e., attack) scenarios, leading to both to questionable defenses and
                                    potential blind spots. In particular, most scenarios ascribe perfect knowledge and
                                    embedding control to the HT owner, consider simple (verging on simplistic) trigger
                                    and payload mechanisms, and cast the HT-attacker-defender interaction as a single
                                    shot game. In this talk, I will discuss a new model for hardware trojans that
                                    targets realistic circuits (i.e., full-blown CPUs) in the context of imperfect
                                    knowledge/control by the attacker and an adaptive defender within a repeated game,
                                    and explore certain implications and technical challenges.
