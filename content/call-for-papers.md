The Information Security Conference (ISC) is an annual international conference covering research in theory and applications of Information Security. ISC aims to attract high quality papers in all technical aspects of information security. This includes submissions from academia, industry and government on traditional as well as emerging topics and new paradigms in these areas, with a clear connection to real-world problems, systems, or applications.

Types of Submissions Solicited
------------------------------

Papers on all technical aspects of information security, cryptography, and privacy are solicited for submission. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

Instructions for Authors
------------------------

Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another journal or conference with proceedings at the time of review. Submissions must be in the [Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)](http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs) style, with the default margins and fonts, but with the addition of page numbers (e.g., by adding \\pagestyle{plain}). They are limited to 16 pages excluding bibliography and appendices, and to 20 pages including bibliography and appendices. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper, but reviewers are not required to read this supplementary material and submissions are expected to be intelligible and complete without it.

Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their LaTeX proceedings template. Springer encourages authors to include their [ORCIDs](https://goo.gl/hbsa4D) in their papers. Submitted papers must be in PDF format and submitted electronically via the [ISC 2024 submission system (HotCRP)](https://isc24.hotcrp.com/). The submission must be **anonymous** with no author names, affiliations, or obvious references.

For papers that are accepted, the corresponding author must, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form, through which the copyright for their paper is transferred to Springer. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. Moreover, authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference.
