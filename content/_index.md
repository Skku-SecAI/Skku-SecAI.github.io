Welcome to the 27th Information Security Conference (ISC) {#welcome-to-the-27th-informationsecurity-conferenceisc}
---------------------------------------------------------

The Information Security Conference (ISC) is an annual international
conference covering research in theory and applications of Information
Security. ISC aims to attract high quality papers in all technical
aspects of information security. This includes submissions from
academia, industry, and government on traditional as well as emerging
topics and new paradigms in these areas, with a clear connection to
real-world problems, systems, or applications.

The 27th edition of ISC will be organized by [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu).
The conference will
be held **in-person** in the greater Washington DC area. 
The proceedings of ISC 2024 will be published as
