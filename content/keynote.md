**Date**: October 23, 2024 \
**Abstract**: Recent threats on computer memory increase the need for memory protection against eavesdropping or tampering, requiring the use of symmetric-key cryptography community for low-latency encryption. This talk discusses research directions and technological advancements of low-latency encryption and its application to memory encryption.

**Biography**: Kazuhiko Minematsu received his B.E., M.E. and Dr.S. degrees at Waseda University, Japan, in 1996, 1998, and 2008. He joined NEC and now works as a Research Fellow working on the design and analysis of symmetric-key cryptography and its application systems. He is also a visiting professor at Yokohama National University from 2019.

**Date**: October 24, 2024 \
**Abstract**: Hardware trojans (HTs) represent one of the most challenging threat models in computer security. Due to the complexity and distributed nature of todayâ€™s electronics supply chains, there has been significant interest in developing scalable and accurate techniques for identifying such embedded malicious logic, at least in critical systems. However, much of the research in such techniques focuses on small target circuits with impractical HT usage (i.e., attack) scenarios, leading to both to questionable defenses and potential blind spots. In particular, most scenarios ascribe perfect knowledge and embedding control to the HT owner, consider simple (verging on simplistic) trigger and payload mechanisms, and cast the HT-attacker-defender interaction as a single shot game.
In this talk, I will discuss a new model for hardware trojans that targets realistic circuits (i.e., full-blown CPUs) in the context of imperfect knowledge/control by the attacker and an adaptive defender within a repeated game, and explore certain implications and technical challenges.

**Biography**: Dr. Angelos D. Keromytis is Professor, John H. Weitnauer EndowedChair, and Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) Eminent Scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His field of research is systems and network security, and applied cryptography.
He came to Georgia Tech from DARPA, where he served as Program Manager in the Information Innovation Office (I2O) from 2014 to 2018. Prior to DARPA, he served as Program Director with the Computer and Network Systems Division in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science & Engineering (CISE) at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Prior to his public service tour, Dr. Keromytis was a faculty member with the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, where he founded the Network Security Lab.
Dr. Keromytis is an elected Fellow of the ACM and the IEEE. He is a co-inventor on 63 issued U.S. patents and an author/co-author of over 300 refereed publications. His work has been cited 30,000 times, with an h-index of 85 and i10-index of 260. He has co-founded four technology startups. He received his Ph.D. (2001) and M.Sc. (1997) in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania, and his B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Crete, Greece. He is a certified PADI Master Instructor, with over 700 dives.
