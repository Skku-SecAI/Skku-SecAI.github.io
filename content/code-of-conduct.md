Thank you for attending ISCâ€™24. At ISC, we are dedicated to providing a safe and enjoyable event experience for all participants, fostering a welcoming environment for open discussion and the exchange of ideas. Harassment in any form will not be tolerated.  

**Our Expectations: Be Inclusive, Considerate, Respectful, and Kind**
- ISC is a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.  
- Always conduct yourself professionally, whether onsite, online, or when using social media, including the ISC hashtag.
- A comfortable and safe environment is key to productivity and creativity. Your actions can impact others, so please be respectful of differing opinions.  
- Harassment and exclusionary behaviors are unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to, threats of violence; discriminatory jokes or language; sharing sexually explicit or violent material; personal insults, particularly those using racist or sexist terms; unwelcome sexual attention; and advocating for or encouraging any of these behaviors. If someone asks you to stop something, you are expected to comply immediately.  
  
**Who is Covered Under This Code of Conduct?**  
  This Code of Conduct applies to all attendees, speakers, sponsors, staff, and volunteers at our events. ISC staff will enforce this Code throughout the event and expects cooperation from all participants.
